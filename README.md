# ðŸŒ  Planets Vs Galaxies Image Classifier

## Overview
PlanetsVsGalaxiesClassifier is a Machine Learning project aimed at classifying astronomical images into two categories: planets and galaxies. This project leverages deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in image classification tasks. The image dataset was built by me.


## Features
- Image dataset made by me
- Image preprocessing
- Data Augmentation
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture
- Training and validation pipelines
- Model evaluation and performance metrics


## ðŸ“‹ Installation
